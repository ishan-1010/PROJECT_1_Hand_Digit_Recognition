# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This Python project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits. It includes a user-friendly GUI that allows users to draw digits, which are then recognized in real-time.

## Features
- Handwritten digit recognition using a CNN model
- Interactive GUI for drawing digits
- Real-time digit recognition
- Utilizes the MNIST dataset

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Deep learning with Keras library
- Tkinter library for building the GUI

## Installation
Install the necessary libraries for this project using pip:
```pip install numpy tensorflow keras pillow```

## Model Architecture
- Input Layer
- Convolutional Layers
- Max Pooling Layers
- Dropout Layers
- Flatten Layer
- Dense Layers

## Training
The model has been trained on the MNIST dataset.
